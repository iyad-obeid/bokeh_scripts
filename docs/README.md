Trying to draw a simple unit circle. Shouldn't be that hard.

### Circle with single point

Even though the circle has "radius=1" you can see that it doesn't reach y = +/- 

### Circle with multiple points
[code](circle_v2.py)

Technically this is a circle but it looks oblong: aspect ratio isn't right.
